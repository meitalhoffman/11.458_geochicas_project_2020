# 11.458_geochicas_project_2020
This is the final project for MIT course 11.458 - Crowd Sourced City in Spring 2020. We worked with the GeoChicas, a feminist mapping collective, to design a twitter campaign about women and space in Barcelona and Buenos Aires.

## 11.458 - Crowd Sourced City
This course is offered at MIT through the Urban Planning Department. It was taught be [Catherine D'Ignazio](https://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/catherine-dignazio) and TA'd by Wonyoung So. For Spring 2020, the course focused on street names. We read and discussed questions such as:
    - who is commemorated in the landscape?
    - who is missing from the landscape?
    - how do memorials and naming conventions reinforce or challenge hegemonic norms?

## GeoChicas
The Geochicas are a femenist Open Street Map (OSM) mapping collective who are working on closing the gender gap in the OSM community. We specifically worked on extending their [Las Calles De Las Mujeres](https://geochicasosm.github.io/lascallesdelasmujeres/) project, which maps the streets named after men and women in several cities in Latin America and Spain.
